# RRG Blog Analyzer

A quick little script I threw together to pull summary data from the Seattle RRG reading notes blog. This script pulls out article titles, article urls and their corresponding dates and outputs it as a CSV. 

Installation:
1. Create a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/#usage)
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Usage: `python rrg_blog_stats.py <posts_dir> <output_file_name>`
